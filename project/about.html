        The nepal cricket team is also known as The Rhinos,is governed by the Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN).
        They have been an Associate Member of the International Cricket Council since 1996, having previously been an
        Affiliate Member since 1988. Nepal were awarded Twenty20 International (T20I) status by the ICC in June 2014
        until the 2015 ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier.On 15 March 2018, Nepal gained One Day International (ODI) status
        for the first time (and regained Twenty20 International status), after winning the first playoff match in the
        2018 Cricket World Cup Qualifier.Nepal made their maiden appearance in the ICC global event at the 2014 ICC
        World Twenty20 in Bangladesh.They have been participating in international matches since 1996, including every
        ACC Trophy tournaments except 2015 ACC Twenty20 Cup in UAE, where they didn't participate. Nepal also participated
        in ICC World Cup Qualifier in 2001 2014 and 2018, ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier in 2012, 2013 and 2015, ICC
        Intercontinental Cup in 2004 and 2005, ACC Fast Track Countries Tournament in 2004, 2005 and 2006, ACC Twenty20
        Cup in 2007, 2009, 2011 and 2013, Asian Games in 2010 and 2014 and ACC Premier League in 2014.Unlike some other
        smaller cricketing nations, where teams are largely made up of expatriates,Nepal's national team comprises
        indigenous players who have usually come through the ranks playing age-group cricket.In April 2018, the ICC
        granted full Twenty20 International (T20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played
        between Nepal and another international side after 1 January 2019 will be a full T20I.
        After gained odi status nepal will be ranked in icc odi ranking and now nepal can tour other country for odi
        series there and icc will provide more fund to the nepali cricket team.<br>Icc is giving more opportunity to the nepal
        than other associate team for nepal is not able to utlise that opportunity due to the some political attack in nepal
        cricket team.so,icc band the government body cricket association of nepal (CAN)so nepal is fully depend on ICC for
        all activites of cricket in nepal.so nepal government have to solve these problem fast otherwise nepal cricket team
        cannot perform well nepalis country where there are lots of talent one eg is sandeep lamichhane at the age of 17 is
        able tp play ipl.Now nepal is going to tour england for odi tour and t20 tour to play with MCC and netherlands.Not
        only that nepali is also playing important match these years nepali playing asia cup qualify and worldcup qualify.
        Nepal cricket team journey in 2018 the national team skipper had given an exciting interview before the start of
        what was a serious heart punching tournament for all the weak hearts and a cardiac patient. He added sweetly with
        a smile in his face, “Coming February will be the Royal Rumbles in Namibia”. Less is more is what a current trend
        in the world is and gee what an exciting tournament it had been for Nepal.Started the tournament in the worst poss
        -ible manner by clinching the victory over Namibia with heroics from Basant Regmi and Sandeep Lamichhane until the
        century of the last over against UAE by the skipper Paras Khadka, this tournament had everything to offer to Namib
        -ia as a host nation.As mentioned by Peter Della Penna towards the end of his article that the cardiac Kids of Khadka
        made the crowds jump in joy at the late night of winter in Kathmandu by qualifying for the World Cup qualifiers in on
        e of the most emphatic fashion with Karan K.c.<br> playing the innings of his life.With Sandeep Lamichhane leading with the
        ball, the tournament had a unique hero everday with Basanta leading the proceedings while Karan KC, Paras Khadka and Sand
        -eep Lamichhane following Regmi’s footmark that led to the joy for Nepalese fans and engraved the belief to advance in the
        pinnacle of all tournaments, the ICC Cricket World Cup 2019 in England.With the national team of Nepal national cricket
        team flying today by Fly Dubai, the hopes, dreams and determination to raise the flag of their nation is flying at the top
        of the night sky that would bring History within itself of being featured in one of the most prestigious tournament of the
        world. Zimbabwe will surely be a proof if Nepal could make some mark with experience players tying their shoe laces while
        youths being able to provide all the energies to them.The stage is set and prayers have being sent directly to the almighty
        without any delay. Hence, the land of Himalaya and deities are all set to roar in Zimbabwe with every pride and prestige just
        one step away from the National cricket team of Nepal.
